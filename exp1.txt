(1) What is DevOps?
 (Ans) 
● DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools 
that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services 
at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than 
organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure 
management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve 
their customers and compete more effectively in the market. 
● DevOps is all about the unification and automation of processes, and 
DevOps engineers are instrumental in combining code, application 
maintenance, and application management. All of these tasks rely on 
understanding not only development life cycles, but DevOps culture, and 
its philosophy, practices, and tools.


(2) Why is DevOps needed?
 (Ans)
● DevOps—the amalgamation of development (Dev) and operations (Ops) 
teams—is an organizational approach that enables faster development of 
applications and easier maintenance of existing deployments. By enabling 
organizations to create stronger bonds between Dev, Ops and other 
stakeholders in the company, DevOps promotes shorter, more controllable 
iterations through the adoption of best practices, automation and new 
tools. DevOps is not a technology per se, but it covers everything from the 
organisation to culture, processes and tooling. Initial steps usually include 
Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), real-time 
monitoring, incident response systems and collaboration platforms.

(4) Why is DevOps used?
 (Ans)
DevOps proponents describe several business and technical benefits, many of 
which can result in happier customers. Some benefits of DevOps include:
● Faster, better product delivery
● Faster issue resolution and reduced complexity
● Greater scalability and availability
● More stable operating environments
● Better resource utilization
● Greater automation
● Greater visibility into system outcomes
● Greater innovation



● Here are some of the key differences between DevOps and traditional IT 
systems: 
1. Culture: DevOps is a cultural shift that emphasizes collaboration 
and communication between development and operations teams. 
Traditional IT systems are often more siloed, with teams working 
independently.
2. Process: DevOps uses a continuous delivery model, where code 
is released frequently and automatically. Traditional IT systems 
often use a waterfall model, where code is released in large 
batches.
3. Tools: De
